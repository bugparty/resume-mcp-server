  - title: Intern Backend Engineer
    organization: Brix
    location: San Francisco, CA
    period: Jan 2025 - Present
    bullets:
    - Developed Gmail integration service using Python and FastAPI with OAuth 2.0
      authentication and Gmail API; implemented real-time email notification system
      using Gmail push notifications and Cloud Pub/Sub webhooks to deliver instant
      updates for incoming messages.
    - Architected background job processing system with RabbitMQ for handling async
      email operations (search, send, label management); designed rate limiting and
      quota management to stay within Gmail API limits while maintaining responsive
      user experience.
    - Optimized database query performance by redesigning PostgreSQL schema and adding
      strategic indexes; reduced average query latency from 2s to 200ms and improved
      system responsiveness.
    - Deployed services using Docker and Kubernetes with automated CI/CD pipelines;
      implemented monitoring and alerting with Prometheus and Grafana for production
      system health tracking.
    - 'Technologies: Python, FastAPI, Gmail API, OAuth 2.0, Cloud Pub/Sub, Docker,
      Kubernetes, PostgreSQL, Redis, RabbitMQ, REST APIs, asyncio.'
  - title: Mobile Engineer
    organization: AparaVR
    location: Hybrid App Platform
    period: Jan 2022 - May 2023
    bullets:
    - Developed hybrid mobile application framework by customizing Android WebView
      and browser kernel (Chromium-based); implemented JavaScript-to-native bridge
      for seamless communication between web content and native Android features.
    - Debugged critical production bug causing 100% black screen crashes in customer's
      VR application; traced issue through entire stack from JavaScript API layer
      through bridge layer to C++ kernel implementation, identifying race condition
      in resource initialization that occurred only under specific timing conditions.
    - Optimized WebView rendering performance and memory usage for complex web applications;
      reduced initial load time by 40% through asset preloading, lazy loading strategies,
      and intelligent caching mechanisms.
    - Built native Android modules in Java and C++ for camera access, file system
      operations, and device sensors; exposed these capabilities to web layer through
      secure bridge APIs with permission management.
    - Collaborated with frontend team to design hybrid architecture supporting both
      web-based UI and native components; enabled rapid iteration on features while
      maintaining native app performance and user experience.
    - 'Technologies: Android (Java), WebView, Chromium, JavaScript bridge, C++ (JNI),
      AOSP, hybrid app architecture, cross-layer debugging.'
  - title: Backend Engineer
    organization: Rolling Blocks
    location: Startup
    period: 2021 - 2022
    bullets:
    - Built and maintained high-availability content delivery infrastructure on AWS,
      serving 10M+ monthly requests; designed auto-scaling architecture using EC2,
      CloudFront CDN, and S3 for static assets, reducing hosting costs by 10x through
      intelligent caching and load distribution.
    - Developed distributed web crawling system using Python and RabbitMQ on AWS Lambda
      for serverless task processing; implemented rate limiting and proxy rotation
      to handle 100K+ daily crawl requests while maintaining compliance.
    - Architected WordPress multi-site deployment with Application Load Balancer (ALB)
      distributing traffic across multiple EC2 instances and RDS (MySQL) for database
      persistence; configured auto-scaling policies and CloudWatch monitoring for
      99.9% uptime.
    - 'Technologies: AWS (EC2, S3, CloudFront, Lambda, RDS, ALB, CloudWatch), Docker,
      Nginx, RabbitMQ, Python (Scrapy), Node.js, Express, React.'

  - title: Resume Editing MCP Server & Agent
    organization: MCP Framework & LLM Agent
    location: ''
    period: 2024–Present
    bullets:
    - Designed and implemented a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server specialized for
      structured resume editing and transformation.
    - Built a task-oriented agent capable of understanding resume semantics (projects,
      skills, timelines) instead of treating resumes as plain text.
    - Implemented LaTeX-aware editing ([github.com/bugparty/resume-mcp-server](https://github.com/bugparty/resume-mcp-server)),
      ensuring commands and formatting remain valid during automated transformations.
    - The agent plans multi-step edits (analyze → rewrite → validate → format) and
      executes them through MCP tools rather than ad-hoc text generation.
    - '**This resume was generated using the agent system itself**, demonstrating
      practical end-to-end capabilities.'
