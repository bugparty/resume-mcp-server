    - AI Infrastructure Engineer with 9+ years of experience in AI and software systems,
      from early Android/Android OS work at Baidu/Meituan to modern LLM fine-tuning
      and reinforcement learning.
    - Specialized in building intelligent agent systems using LLM-based architectures
      (DeepSeek, LLaMA), RL algorithms (PPO, DQN), and frameworks like FastMCP, LangChain,
      LangGraph, and FastAPI.
    - Enable enterprises to deploy cost-efficient local agent systems by fine-tuning
      smaller models (8B-32B) with RL, eliminating expensive ChatGPT API dependencies
      and reducing inference costs by orders of magnitude; currently pursuing Master's
      in Computer Engineering at UC Riverside.
